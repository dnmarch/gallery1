        <h2>San Francisco</h2>
        <p>
          San Francisco,[23] officially the City and County of San Francisco, is
          a commercial, financial, and cultural center within Northern
          California. With a population of 808,988 residents as of 2023,[14] San
          Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in the U.S. state of
          California behind Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose, and the 17th
          most populous in the US. It covers a land area of 46.9 square miles
          (121 square kilometers)[24] at the upper end of the San Francisco
          Peninsula, making it the second-most densely populated major U.S. city
          behind New York City and the fifth-most densely populated U.S. county,
          behind four of New York City's boroughs. Among the 91 U.S. cities
          proper with over 250,000 residents, San Francisco is ranked first by
          per capita income and sixth by aggregate income as of 2023.[25] San
          Francisco anchors the 13th most populous metropolitan statistical area
          in the United States, with almost 4.6 million residents in 2023. The
          larger San Jose–San Francisco–Oakland combined statistical area, the
          fifth-largest urban region in the U.S., had a 2023 estimated
          population of over nine million.
