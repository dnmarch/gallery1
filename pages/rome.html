        <h2>Rome</h2>
        <p>
          Rome (Italian and Latin: Roma, pronounced [ˈroːma] ⓘ) is the capital
          city of Italy. It is also the capital of the Lazio region, the centre
          of the Metropolitan City of Rome Capital, and a special comune
          (municipality) named Comune di Roma Capitale. With 2,860,009 residents
          in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi),[2] Rome is the country's most populated
          comune and the third most populous city in the European Union by
          population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a
          population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous metropolitan
          city in Italy.[3] Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous
          within Italy.[5] Rome is located in the central-western portion of the
          Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the
          Tiber Valley. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world and
          headquarters of the worldwide Catholic Church under the governance of
          the Holy See)[6] is an independent country inside the city boundaries
          of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city. Rome is
          often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic
          location, and also as the "Eternal City". Rome is generally considered
          to be the cradle of Western civilization and Western Christian
          culture, and the centre of the Catholic Church.[7][8][9]
